Description: Software-driven hardware development framework
 Connectal provides a hardware-software interface for applications
 split between user mode code and custom hardware in an FPGA. Portal
 can automatically build the software and hardware glue for a message
 based interface and also provides for configuring and using shared
 memory between applications and hardware. Communications between
 hardware and software are provided by a bidirectional flow of events
 and regions of memory shared between hardware and software. Events
 from software to hardware are called requests and events from
 hardware to software are called indications, but in fact they are
 symmetric.
